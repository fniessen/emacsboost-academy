EmacsBoost practice file
=========================

This file is used to practice basic and advanced Emacs editing commands.
You can move around, edit text, search and replace, record macros,
try rectangle commands and many other features.

The word editor appears several times in this paragraph. Emacs is a very
powerful editor. Some people call it a text editor, others call it a
programmable editor or even an operating system disguised as an editor.
When you are done with these exercises, you will probably feel that your
editor has become a true text processor.

Try to notice   how    extra   spaces   look in this sentence.  Some words
have   double   or   triple spaces before or after them.  Clean them up
so that the sentence uses normal spacing only.

Here is a mixed case paragraph about your favorite hobby. maybe you like
programming, or Playing piano, or hiking in the Mountains. emacs can help
you keep notes, Plan trips, and write code. use this text to practice
uppercasing, lowercasing and Capitalizing words with Emacs commands.


Shopping list
-------------

milk
Eggs
butter
dark chocolate
pasta
tomatoes
olive oil
Coffee
butter
MILK

Use this list to practice:
- moving by words and lines
- changing case of words
- sorting lines
- removing duplicate lines
- recording and replaying macros


Short poem or quote
-------------------

the cursor moves, the buffer stays
keystrokes dance in quiet ways
from line to line, from word to word
silence kept, yet commands heard


List of random words
--------------------

banana
apple
orange
kiwi
apple
mango
grape
banana
pear
fig
grapefruit
kiwi
plum
plum
date

Use this block to practice sort-lines and delete-duplicate-lines.


Columnar data for rectangle editing
-----------------------------------

ID   Name              Language      Score
001  Alice Johnson     Python        87
002  Bob Smith         C++           92
003  Carla Gomez       Emacs Lisp    78
004  Daniel Ito        Java          88
005  Eva Müller        Rust          95
006  Farid Khan        Python        83
007  Grace Lee         JavaScript    90
008  Henry O'Neil      Emacs Lisp    80

Hints:
- Add a prefix like "# " to all data lines using a rectangle command.
- Insert sequential numbers at the beginning of each line.
- Align the Language column differently.
- Try adding a timestamp at the start of each line with a macro.


Email addresses in inconsistent formats
---------------------------------------

John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
jane.smith@example.org
"Boss, Big" <big.boss@corporate.example>
lucy@example.com (Lucy)
martin dupont <martin.dupont@example.fr>
ALICE@example.com
bob.builder at example dot com
No Name <noname@example.net>
first.last@example.com
J. Random Hacker <jrh@example.edu>

Use this section to practice:
- search and replace
- keyboard macros that normalize email formats
- kill and yank operations
- rectangle edits on the domain part


Messy paragraph for narrowing, filling and cleaning
---------------------------------------------------

This paragraph is intentionally written with
strange line breaks, so that you can practice
filling and refilling text with M-q. The goal is
to make the paragraph look clean and nicely
wrapped at a reasonable fill column. While you are
editing, try to narrow to this region only, then
widen again when you are done. Also feel free to
insert additional sentences about why you like
Emacs as your main editor for daily work.


Tiny Python snippet
-------------------

def add(a,  b):
    """Return the sum of a and b."""
    total = a  +  b
    return  total


def greet(name):
    message = "Hello, "  +  name + "!"
    print(message)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = add(2,  3)
    greet("Emacs user")
    print("Result:",   result)

Use this code to:
- move by words, symbols and lines
- practice indentation changes
- try commenting and uncommenting regions
- experiment with macros that adjust spacing around operators


Tiny Emacs Lisp snippet
-----------------------

(defun emacs-boost-hello ()
  "Simple function used for EmacsBoost practice."
  (interactive)
  (message "Hello from EmacsBoost practice file!"))

(defun emacs-boost-add (x y)
  "Return the sum of X and Y."
  (+ x y))

;; Try evaluating these functions, changing their names,
;; and adding your own variants.


Org like checklist (plain text)
-------------------------------

[ ] Install a new theme
[ ] Enable which-key mode
[ ] Configure avy for quick navigation
[ ] Create a simple yasnippet
[ ] Set up an Emacs server and use emacsclient
[ ] Learn one new keybinding today
[ ] Review all exercises at the end of the week

Use this section to:
- toggle the brackets manually
- practice macros that turn [ ] into [X]
- search for unfinished items


Mixed language paragraph
------------------------

Emacs peut aussi servir pour écrire en plusieurs langues.
You can mix French and English in the same buffer.
Ceci te permet de pratiquer les mouvements par mots,
les commandes de recherche, et les remplacements
sélectifs sur certaines expressions seulement.


End of practice file
--------------------

When you reach this line, you have explored every section of
practice.txt. Feel free to duplicate blocks, insert new ones,
break the formatting on purpose and then try to repair it using
the Emacs skills you are learning.
